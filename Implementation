•	Find the cluster of objects in a single pic.
•	Find the picture of an image in the cluster.
•	Match both pictures using matlab
•	Find the common points and detect the image



FLOW CHART FOR THE PROCESS

THINGS IN THE CLUSTER:-

•	Bottle

•	Comb

•	Shoe

•	Watch

•	Phone






PROCESS OF SIMULATION AND RESULTS:-


Process of simulation
•	 Detection 
•	Description 
•	Matching


Detection:-

Automatically identify interesting features, interest points this must be done robustly. The same feature should always be detected regardless of viewpoint.


Description:-

Each interest point should have a unique description that does not depend on the features scale and rotation.



Matching:-

The input image, determine which objects it contains, and possibly a transformation of the object, based on predetermined interest points. 
In this paper, we are use SURF algorithm to detect features because of it should provide better results, faster than SIFT algorithm.
SURF uses a hessian based blob detector to find interest points. The determinant of a hessian matrix expresses the extent of the response 
and is an expression of the local change around the area.
