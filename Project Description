The purpose of feature extraction technique in image processing is to represent the image in its compact and unique form 
of single values or matrix vector. Low level feature extraction involves automatic extraction of features from an image 
without doing any processing method. In this paper, we consider the use of high level feature extraction technique to 
investigate the characteristic of narrow and broad weed by implementing the 2 dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D-DWT) 
as the processing method.Most transformation techniques produce coefficient values with the same size as the original image. 
Further processing of the coefficient values must be applied to extract the image feature vectors. In this paper, 
we propose an algorithm to implement feature extraction technique using the 2D-DWT and the extracted coefficients are 
used to represent the image for classification of narrow and broad weed. Results obtained suggest that the extracted 2D-DWT
coefficients can uniquely represents the two different weed type.
